# 2021-gun-dealer-inspections-data
Geocoded version of The Trace &amp; USA Today's ATF Exposé • https://projects.thetrace.org/inspections/

The Trace/USA Today provided the data in CSV format but it did not include the geocoded longitude & latitude. However, that data was available in a `<script>` tag on the page linked above. 14 had no geocoding information from that `<script>` tag and, thus, are not in the geojson version of the data.

The `license_type` field was used to join license description data from <https://www.atf.gov/resource-center/fact-sheet/fact-sheet-federal-firearms-and-explosives-licenses-types>.
